# Weather App Coding Test

URL: https://weather-frontend-kgn2p24n5-waldorfio.vercel.app/

## Project Overview

This project is a weather application with both front and back end components. Below are some areas where improvements could be made if additional time were available.

## Opportunities for Improvement

1. **Server-Side API Protection:**
   - Currently, there is no barrier to protecting the server-side API routes. Implementing a server-side code within the frontend or a login system could protect API routes from unauthorized access.

2. **Autocomplete Search Bars:**
   - Due to limitations with the AccuWeather API, autocomplete search bars weren't implemented as they consume a significant portion of the API requests. With unlimited requests, implementing autocomplete search bars or storing geolocations/keys in a database for efficient querying could improve application flow.

3. **Enhanced Forecast Features:**
   - Although daily and hourly forecasts were implemented, additional features like social sharing or extended 7-day forecasts were not included due to time constraints. Implementing these features would enrich the user experience.

4. **User Preferences Modal:**
   - A user preferences modal was created with the intention of storing additional settings such as dark mode. Given more time, this feature could be further developed and integrated into the application.

5. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - With more time, errors and warnings could be displayed more effectively, for example, through the implementation of a toast or snackbar system. This would enhance user feedback and experience.

6. **Additional Unit Control:**
   - Currently, the application supports switching between imperial and metric units for certain parameters like temperature. Expanding this feature to include other parameters such as wind speed would provide users with more customization options.

7. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Given more time, the application's design could be optimized for better viewing and usability on mobile devices. This would ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes.

## Conclusion

These are some areas where the weather application could be enhanced with additional development time. Each improvement has the potential to make the application more robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich.
